#  What is Amazon ECR?
# Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) is a fully managed Docker container registry provided by AWS. It allows you to:

# Store, manage, and deploy Docker container images.
# Integrate directly with Amazon SageMaker, ECS, EKS, and other AWS services.
# Securely control access to your container images using IAM.
# Why You Need ECR for SageMaker
# When you build a custom Docker image (like your gencast-image), SageMaker needs to pull that image from somewhere. ECR is the AWS-native place to host it.

# So the flow looks like this:

# You build your Docker image locally (e.g., gencast-image).
# You push it to ECR (your private container registry on AWS).
# SageMaker pulls the image from ECR when deploying your model.
#  Analogy
# Think of ECR like a private GitHub for Docker images:

# You push your image to it.
# AWS services (like SageMaker) pull from it to run your code.

# to run the file: 
#chmod +x push_to_ecr.sh
#./push_to_ecr.sh
